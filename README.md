<strong>Rocketseat - Stage 03 / Projeto 04</strong>

I developed this during Rocketseat initial classes about responsive coding.

I had the opportunity to learn about mobile first concept, @media rule and also the pseudo-class of :first-child.

The original layout was available for reference <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ChoTjbRlrV2rfzKgDH5bkP/Explorer-Stage-03-Projeto-02-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=203-412&t=ZOjfIWF3hhGe4Ew5-0">here</a>.

It was fun to see my own work responsive for the first time :)
